1. Populate **Import source**, Choose **Directory** and browse through the file system to select the pre\-defined project folder\. The project contained within has links to the source folders in the same repository\.  
![\[Populate the import source field\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/m2/latest/userguide/images/ed-uc3-step4.png)

   Choose **Finish**\.

   Because the project is populated by the links to the source folder, the code is automatically built\.
