# Tutorial: Use templates with Micro Focus Enterprise Developer<a name="tutorial-templates-ed"></a>

This tutorial describes how to use templates and predefined projects with Micro Focus Enterprise Developer\. It covers three use cases\. All of the use cases use the sample code provided in the BankDemo sample\. To download the sample, choose [https://d1vi4vxke6c2hu.cloudfront.net/demo/bankdemo.zip](https://d1vi4vxke6c2hu.cloudfront.net/demo/bankdemo.zip) \.

**Important**  
If you use the version of Enterprise Developer for Windows, the binaries generated by the compiler can run only on the Enterprise Server provided with Enterprise Developer\. You cannot run them under the AWS Mainframe Modernization runtime, which is based on Linux\.

## Use Case 1 \- Using the COBOL Project Template containing source components<a name="tutorial-templates-ed-step1"></a>

This use case requires you to copy the source components into the Template directory structure as part of the demo pre setup steps\. In the [https://d1vi4vxke6c2hu.cloudfront.net/demo/bankdemo.zip](https://d1vi4vxke6c2hu.cloudfront.net/demo/bankdemo.zip) this has been changed from the original `AWSTemplates.zip` delivery to avoid having two copies of the source\.

1. Start Enterprise Developer and specify the chosen workspace\.  
![\[The Eclipse launcher with a workspace selected.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/m2/latest/userguide/images/ed-uc1-step1.png)

1. Within the **Application Explorer** view, from the **Enterprise Development Project** tree view item, choose **New Project from Template** from the context menu\.  
![\[The enterprise development project tree view context menu.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/m2/latest/userguide/images/ed-uc1-step2.png)

1. Enter the template parameters as shown\.
**Note**  
The Template Path will refer to where the ZIP was extracted\.  
![\[The Enter template parameters box with the path and project name filled in.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/m2/latest/userguide/images/ed-uc1-step3.png)

1. Choosing OK will create a local development Eclipse Project based on the provided template, with a complete source and execution environment structure\.  
![\[The local development Eclipse project showing its structure.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/m2/latest/userguide/images/ed-uc1-step4.png)

   The `System` structure contains a complete resource definition file with the required entries for BANKDEMO, the required catalog with entries added and the corresponding ASCII data files\.

   Because the source template structure contains all the source items, these files are copied to the local project and therefore are automatically built in Enterprise Developer\.

## Use Case 2 \- Using the COBOL Project Template without source components<a name="tutorial-templates-ed-step2"></a>

Steps 1 to 3 are identical to [Use Case 1 \- Using the COBOL Project Template containing source components](#tutorial-templates-ed-step1)\. 

The `System` structure in this use case also contains a complete resource definition file with the required entries for BankDemo, the required catalog with entries added, and the corresponding ASCII data files\.

However, the template source structure does not contain any components\. You must import these into the project from whatever source repository you are using\.

1. Choose the project name\. From the related context menu, choose **Import**\.  
![\[The project context menu with import selected.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/m2/latest/userguide/images/ed-uc2-step4.png)

1. From the resulting dialog, under the **General** section, choose **File System** and then choose Next\.  
![\[The Import box with file system selected.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/m2/latest/userguide/images/ed-uc2-step5.png)

1. Populate the **From directory** field by browsing the file system to point to the repository folder\. Choose all the folders you wish to import, such as `sources`\. The `Into folder` field will be pre\-populated\. Choose **Finish**\.   
![\[The File system box with the BankDemo directory expanded.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/m2/latest/userguide/images/ed-uc2-step6.png)

   After the source template structure contains all the source items, they are built automatically in Enterprise Developer\.

## Use Case 3 \- Using the pre\-defined COBOL project linking to the source folders<a name="tutorial-templates-ed-step3"></a>

1. Start Enterprise Developer and specify the chosen workspace\.  
![\[The Eclipse launcher with a workspace selected.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/m2/latest/userguide/images/ed-uc3-step1.png)

1. From the **File** menu, choose **Import**\.  
![\[The File menu with Import selected.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/m2/latest/userguide/images/ed-uc3-step2.png)

1. From the resulting dialog, under **General**, choose **Projects from Folder or Archive** and choose **Next**\.  
![\[The Import box with projects from folder or archive selected.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/m2/latest/userguide/images/ed-uc3-step3.png)

1. Populate **Import source**, Choose **Directory** and browse through the file system to select the pre\-defined project folder\. The project contained within has links to the source folders in the same repository\.  
![\[The import projects from file system or archive box with the path to the import source entered.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/m2/latest/userguide/images/ed-uc3-step4.png)

   Choose **Finish**\.

   Because the project is populated by the links to the source folder, the code is automatically built\.

## Using the Region Definition JSON Template<a name="tutorial-templates-ed-step4"></a>

1. Switch to the Server Explorer view\. From the related context menu, choose **Open Administration Page**, which starts the default browser\.  
![\[The server explorer context menu with open administration page selected.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/m2/latest/userguide/images/ed-json-admin-page.png)

1. From the resulting Enterprise Server Common Web Administration \(ESCWA\) screen, choose **Import** \.  
![\[The Enterprise Server Common Web Admknistration screen with Import selected.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/m2/latest/userguide/images/ed-json-import.png)

1. Choose the **JSON** import type and choose **Next**\.  
![\[The choose import type box with JSON selected.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/m2/latest/userguide/images/ed-json-import-type.png)

1. Upload the supplied `BANKDEMO.JSON` file\.  
![\[The choose file to upload box with the BANKDEMO file selected.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/m2/latest/userguide/images/ed-json-upload.png)

   Once selected, choose **Next**\.  
![\[The select regions box with clear ports from endpoints not selected.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/m2/latest/userguide/images/ed-json-next.png)

   On the **Select Regions** panel, ensure that the **Clear Ports from Endpoints** option is not selected, and then continue to choose **Next** through the panels until the **Perform Import** panel is shown\. Then choose **Import**\.   
![\[The Import button.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/m2/latest/userguide/images/ed-json-import-button.png)

   Finally click **Finish**\. The BANKDEMO region will then be added to the server list\.  
![\[The Region and server list with BankDemo added.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/m2/latest/userguide/images/ed-json-server-list.png)

1. Navigate to the **General Properties** for the BANKDEMO region\.

1. Scroll to the **Configuration** section\.

1. The ESP environment variable needs to be set to the `System` folder relevant to the Eclipse Project created in the previous steps\. This should be `workspacefolder/projectname/System`\.  
![\[The configuration section with the ESP variable shown.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/m2/latest/userguide/images/ed-json-ESP.png)

1. Click **Apply**\.  
![\[The Apply button\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/m2/latest/userguide/images/ed-json-apply-button.png)

   The region is now fully configured to run in conjunction with the Eclipse COBOL project\.

1. Finally, back in Enterprise Developer, associate the imported region with the project\.  
![\[The project context menu with Associated with project selected.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/m2/latest/userguide/images/ed-json-associate.png)

   The Enterprise Developer environment is now ready to use, with a complete working version of BankDemo\. You can edit, compile, and debug code against the region\.
**Important**  
If you use the version of Enterprise Developer for Windows, the binaries generated by the compiler can run only on the Enterprise Server provided with Enterprise Developer\. You cannot run them under the AWS Mainframe Modernization runtime, which is based on Linux\.
