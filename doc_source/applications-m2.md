# Applications in AWS Mainframe Modernization<a name="applications-m2"></a>

If you're new to AWS Mainframe Modernization see the following topics to get started:
+ [What is AWS Mainframe Modernization?](what-is-m2.md)
+ [Setting up AWS Mainframe Modernization](setting-up.md)
+ [Tutorial: Managed Runtime for Blu Age](tutorial-runtime-ba.md)
+ [Tutorial: Managed runtime for Micro Focus](tutorial-runtime-mf.md)

An application in AWS Mainframe Modernization contains a migrated mainframe workload\. The application is analogous to a workload on the mainframe and is associated with a runtime environment\. You can add batch files and data sets to applications and monitor applications as they run\. You create AWS Mainframe Modernization applications for each workload that you migrate\. When you create an AWS Mainframe Modernization application, you specify the engine that the application runs on when you create it\. Choose Blu Age if you are using the automated refactoring pattern, and choose Micro Focus if you are using the replatforming pattern\.
