# What is AWS Mainframe Modernization?<a name="what-is-m2"></a>

AWS Mainframe Modernization provides tools and resources to help you plan and implement migration and modernization from mainframes to AWS managed runtime environments\. It provides tools for analyzing existing mainframe applications, developing or updating mainframe applications using COBOL or PL/I, and implementing an automated pipeline for continuous integration and continuous delivery \(CI/CD\) of the applications\.

AWS Mainframe Modernization uses a four\-stage process:
+ Analyze: use the analysis tool to analyze your applications and dependencies so you can assess what you need to do and plan for it\.
+ Develop: update your applications as needed for the migration and modernization process\. Also, update them for ongoing maintenance\.
+ Deploy: create runtime environments and deploy your applications to them\.
+ Operate: manage and run your applications in AWS managed runtime environments\.
